=head1 NAME

GnuPG::PrimaryKey - GnuPG Primary Key Objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # assumes a GnuPG::Interface object in $gnupg
  my @keys = $gnupg->get_public_keys( 'ftobin' );

  # or

  my @keys = $gnupg->get_secret_keys( 'ftobin' );

  # now GnuPG::PrimaryKey objects are in @keys

=head1 DESCRIPTION

GnuPG::PrimaryKey objects are generally instantiated
as GnuPG::PublicKey or GnuPG::SecretKey objects
through various methods of GnuPG::Interface.
They embody various aspects of a GnuPG primary key.

This package inherits data members and object methods
from GnuPG::Key, which is not described here, but rather
in L<GnuPG::Key>.

=head1 OBJECT DATA MEMBERS

=over 4

=item user_ids

A list of GnuPG::UserId objects associated with this key.

=item user_attributes

A list of GnuPG::UserAttribute objects associated with this key.

=item subkeys

A list of GnuPG::SubKey objects associated with this key.

=item local_id

WARNING: DO NOT USE.  This used to mean GnuPG's local id for the key,
but modern versions of GnuPG do not produce it.  Expect this to be the
empty string or undef.

=item owner_trust

The scalar value GnuPG reports as the ownertrust for this key.
See GnuPG's DETAILS file for details.
