=head1 NAME

GnuPG::PrimaryKey - GnuPG Primary Key Objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # assumes a GnuPG::Interface object in $gnupg
  my @keys = $gnupg->get_public_keys( 'ftobin' );

  # or

  my @keys = $gnupg->get_secret_keys( 'ftobin' );

  # now GnuPG::PrimaryKey objects are in @keys

=head1 DESCRIPTION

GnuPG::PrimaryKey objects are generally instantiated
as GnuPG::PublicKey or GnuPG::SecretKey objects
through various methods of GnuPG::Interface.
They embody various aspects of a GnuPG primary key.

This package inherits data members and object methods
from GnuPG::Key, which is not described here, but rather
in L<GnuPG::Key>.

=head1 OBJECT DATA MEMBERS

Note that these data members are interacted with via object methods
created using the methods described in L<Class::MethodMaker/"get_set">,
L<Class::MethodMaker/"object">, or L<Class::MethodMaker/"list">.
Please read there for more information.
