=head1 NAME

GnuPG::SecretKey - GnuPG Secret Key Objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # assumes a GnuPG::Interface object in $gnupg
  my @keys = $gnupg->get_secret_keys( 'ftobin' );

  # now GnuPG::SecretKey objects are in @keys

=head1 DESCRIPTION

GnuPG::SecretKey objects are generally instantiated
through various methods of GnuPG::Interface.
They embody various aspects of a GnuPG secret key.

This package inherits data members and object methods
from GnuPG::PrimaryKey, which is described here, but rather
in L<GnuPG::PrimaryKey>.

Currently, this package is functionally no different
from GnuPG::PrimaryKey.
