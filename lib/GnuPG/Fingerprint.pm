=head1 NAME

GnuPG::Fingerprint - GnuPG Fingerprint Objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # assumes a GnuPG::Key in $key
  my $fingerprint = $key->fingerprint->as_hex_string();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

GnuPG::Fingerprint objects are generally part of GnuPG::Key
objects, and are not created on their own.

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=head2 Initialization Methods

=over 4

=item new( I<%initialization_args> )

This methods creates a new object.  The optional arguments are
initialization of data members; the initialization is done
in a manner according to the method created as described
in L<Class::MethodMaker/"new_hash_init">.

=item hash_init( I<%args> ).

This method works as described in L<Class::MethodMaker/"new_hash_init">.

=head1 OBJECT DATA MEMBERS

Note that these data members are interacted with via object methods
created using the methods described in L<Class::MethodMaker/"get_set">,
or L<Class::MethodMaker/"object">.
Please read there for more information.

=over 4

=item as_hex_string

This is the hex value of the fingerprint that the object embodies,
in string format.
