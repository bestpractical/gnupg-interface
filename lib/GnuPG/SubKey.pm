=head1 NAME

GnuPG::SubKey - GnuPG Sub Key objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # assumes a GnuPG::PublicKey object in $key
  my @subkeys = $key->subkeys();

  # now GnuPG::SubKey objects are in @subkeys

=head1 DESCRIPTION

GnuPG::SubKey objects are generally instantiated
through various methods of GnuPG::Interface.
They embody various aspects of a GnuPG sub key.

This package inherits data members and object methods
from GnuPG::Key, which are not described here, but rather
in L<GnuPG::Key>.

=head1 OBJECT DATA MEMBERS

Note that these data members are interacted with via object methods
created using the methods described in L<Class::MethodMaker/"get_set">,
L<Class::MethodMaker/"object">, or L<Class::MethodMaker/"list">.
Please read there for more information.

=item validity

A scalar holding the value GnuPG reports for the trust of authenticity
(a.k.a.) validity of a key.
See GnuPG's DETAILS file for details.

=item local_id

GnuPG's local id for the key.

=item owner_trust

The scalar value GnuPG reports as the ownertrust for this key.
See GnuPG's DETAILS file for details.

=item signature

A GnuPG::Signature object holding the representation of the
signature on this key.
