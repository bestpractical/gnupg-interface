0.42_02 - 2010-06-05
 - Additional cleanups from dkg

0.42_01 - 2010-05-10
 - GnuPG::Revoker: improve docs, compare() should fail if the signature
   counts differ - dkg
 - Handle revoker packets (rvk) - dkg
 - Move compare() into GnuPG::Signature, got rid of
   t/GnuPG/ComparableSignature.pm - dkg
 - Move signature comparison into ComparableKey.pm instead of
   ComparableSubKey.pm - dkg
 - Move fingerprint comparison directly into GnuPG::Fingerprint - dkg
 - Change around some variable names for consistency's sake:
      $current_key becomes $current_primary_key
      $current_fingerprinted_key becomes $current_key  -dkg
 - Fixed synopsis example in GnuPG::Signature pod - dkg
 - Allow for primary key to have per-key (useful for signatures of class
   0x1f, see http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-5.2.1) - dkg
 - Add revocations to keys and user ids and user attributes - dkg
 - Add signature class and exportability to GnuPG::Signature - dkg
 - Introduced GnuPG::UserAttribute to handle uat packets - dkg
 - Actually check validity of signatures and report them - dkg
 - Support more than 1 signature over each subkey - dkg
 - Do not bother shipping test/random_seed - dkg
 - Fix copy method of GnuPG::Options:
     The result of not checking for definedness here is to never copy the
     meta_immutable value successfully (as that is true by default).  This led
     to a FTBFS (failure to build from source) when running non-interactively.
     See also:  http://bugs.debian.org/549743  - Tim Retout

0.34 - 2002-09-26
 - Documentation fixes.

0.33 - 2002-06-14
 - Fixed a bug in GnuPG::Interface->import_keys() so that it doesn't
   overwrite your 'command_args' anymore.  Thanks to Peter Palfrader
   <weasel@debian.org> for pointing this out.

0.32 - 2002-06-11
 - Extended the expiration on the test keys another 4 years so that the
   test suite works.
 - Documentation fixes.
 - Other small cleanups.

0.31 - 2001-05-03
 - Fixed stalling test cases.
 - Added deprecation support for fields of GnuPG::Interface::wrap_call

0.30 - 2001-05-01
 - Re-worked inheritance tree so that GnuPG::SecretKey and
   GnuPG::PublicKey are sub-classes of newly-added GnuPG::PrimaryKey.
 - Tested with GnuPG 1.0.5.
 - GnuPG::Fingerprint deprecate hex_data(), in favor of as_hex_string().
 - GnuPG::UserId deprecates user_id_string(), in favor of as_string().

0.20 - 2001-04-28
 - Fixes for running under Perl 5.6.0 (stdin, stdout, stderr
   filehandling changed).  Thanks to Paul Walmsley,
   the_shag@users.sourceforge.net
 - Fix testing so that it works with GnuPG 1.0.4h.
 - Move a lot of testing code from inside the code to outside, so that
   it doesn't need to be loaded along with normal usage.  This might
   help speed.
 - License is now the same terms as perl itself.
 - Don't ship with Class::MethodMaker

0.11 - 2000-08-08
 - AutoLoader is now used correctly.
 - GnuPG::Options->no_comment() is no longer exists, for clarity.  (It
   doesn't do what you think it does).
 - GnuPG::Options->comment() will now only not cause a --comment option
   to be used if it's value is undefined.  This means you can do
   $gnupg->options->comment( '' ) to prevent a comment from being used.

0.10 - 2000-07-13
 - GnuPG::Interface should work fine with the recently- released GnuPG
   1.0.2.
 - GnuPG::Handles objects can now handle reading or writing directly
   from already-opened filehandles.  This can allow a more 'natural'
   approach to having GnuPG read and write directly to files, with the
   exeption being that the user has to open these files beforehand.
 - Documentation created to describe the new accessing of open
   filehandle behaviour, and a FAQ started in GnuPG::Interface's docs.
 - Major code cleanup and other small docs cleanup.

0.09 - 2000-06-26
 - Using GnuPG::Handles which are meant to be dupes is now more viable
   and documented.  In particular, file descriptor numbers (properly
   prefixed, according to the open() documentation) can be used.  This
   helps when using symbols and and object handles.

0.08 - 2000-06-21
 - AutoLoader is now used; this may descrease compile-time.
 - Changes so that testing on recent development versions of GnuPG
   (namely 1.0.1e) works, or notably says that the error is occuring
   because of GnuPG version differences.

0.07 - 2000-05-25
 - BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY issue: GnuPG::Options->meta_signing_key() now
   expects an argument of type GnuPG::Object, instead of a scalar key
   id.  See the following note for more details.
 - GnuPG::Options 'meta' methods that deal with keys arguments are more
   consistent now.  Meta methods that accept key ids are now appended
   with _id(s); other meta methods that accept keys receive GnuPG::Key
   objects.


0.06 - 2000-05-18
 - textmode option added to GnuPG::Options, and booleans of
   GnuPG::Options now make use of Class::MethodMaker's boolean
   usability.

0.04 - 2000-04-26
 - This is a re-packaging release of 0.03.

0.03 - 2000-04-25
 - Documenation fixes.
 - GnuPG::Option meta-pgp5-compatibility bug fixed.

0.01 - 2000-04-19
 - Initial release
